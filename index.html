    <h2>Biography</h2>

<div>

<p>Hello! My name is Jean and I am a beginner web developer. I graduated from Montclair State University in July of 2020, and got my bachelor's degree in marketing.</p>
<p>I live in New Jersey, but one day I would love to travel around the world! My goal is to get a passport so I visit other countries and learn more about their cultures and</p>
<p>cuisines! Right now, I currently work for an insurance company as a customer service billing representative. I wanted to get into web development because I noticed that when I</p>
<p>worked in customer service roles, customers would always have a difficult time navigating the website. This inspired me to learn more about how websites are created and</p>
<p>how I can improve upon that so customers can have a more positive experience with the websites they browse.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>

    <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include knitting, drawing, playing video games, listening to music, and baking. Since this time of year is around the holidays,</p> 
    <p>I have been baking a lot of cookies. My personal favorite are chocolate chip cookies. Even if the final result does not turn out the way I planned, I always love learning new things.</p> 
    <p>Just knowing that I made something by myself makes me proud to show off my creations to friends and family! I have been knitting for about 2 years now, and have made quite a few items for my collection.</p>
    <p>Some of those items include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Scarves</li>
        <li>Hats</li>
        <li>Hand warmers</li>
        <li>A sweater</li>
        <li>Future project: blanket</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>Below are some pictures of some of my creations and what yarn I like to use for knitting!</p>

    <h2>Blog article about Variable Fonts:</h2>

    <div>

        <p>Did you know that before variable fonts existed, web developers had several different font files for static fonts? This was because each file was for the font’s weight, width, and their style combination. 
            Some examples of these files included “'Roboto Regular', 'Roboto Bold', and 'Roboto Bold Italic',” just for the Roboto font (https://developer.mozilla.org). When combined, this would create one typeface 
            displayed on the webpage. This was inconvenient for web developers because not only would they have to make separate files for each font style and weight, this would also put a strain on the web server 
            as well because it would create many http requests, causing the webpage to slowly load. With the help of variable fonts, this allowed web developers to condense everything into one file and have access to 
            all the information available.
            “As of May 2020 variable fonts are supported in most browsers.” (https://web.dev/variable-fonts/). This is important because when more browsers are supported with variable fonts, this allows them to become 
            accessible to more users, allowing for a better user-friendly experience. The most common variable used is weight. The weight variable is connected to the bold style and depending on which location on the 
            scale is chosen, the determines the type of bold style that will show on the typeface. This is determined by a point called an ‘instance’ on the scale that ranges from thin to thick. For example, “Weight axis 
            location 600 is called SemiBold.” (https://web.dev/variable-fonts/). This may seem like a lot to the beginner web developer, but with many choices available, this allows them to get creative with their typeface.
            There are five main properties for variable fonts: weight, width, slant, optical size, and italics. Not all fonts contain all five of these values, so it is important to make sure to check and see if these properties 
            are available for each font that you choose. If a web developer wants to make something artistic using these axes, then it would be best to experiment with either the title of the webpage, or a section that is not in 
            the body. This is to prevent any risks with the readability of the webpage and still making sure that it fits within the accessibility guidelines.
            After reading this blog, you may ask yourself, how can I get started on using variable fonts? One website you can visit is axis-praxis.org. On there, you can play around with the different fonts, sizes, and widths to see 
            what works best on your browser. Another website to play around with variable fonts is v-font.com. After playing around with variable fonts on axis-praxis.org, I have attached below the variable font I have made with their website.</p>
