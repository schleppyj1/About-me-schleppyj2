    <h2>Biography</h2>

<div>

<p>Hello! My name is Jean and I am a beginner web developer. I graduated from Montclair State University in July of 2020, and got my bachelor's degree in marketing.</p>
<p>I live in New Jersey, but one day I would love to travel around the world! My goal is to get a passport so I visit other countries and learn more about their cultures and</p>
<p>cuisines! Right now, I currently work for an insurance company as a customer service billing representative. I wanted to get into web development because I noticed that when I</p>
<p>worked in customer service roles, customers would always have a difficult time navigating the website. This inspired me to learn more about how websites are created and</p>
<p>how I can improve upon that so customers can have a more positive experience with the websites they browse.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>

    <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include knitting, drawing, playing video games, listening to music, and baking. Since this time of year is around the holidays,</p> 
    <p>I have been baking a lot of cookies. My personal favorite are chocolate chip cookies. Even if the final result does not turn out the way I planned, I always love learning new things.</p> 
    <p>Just knowing that I made something by myself makes me proud to show off my creations to friends and family! I have been knitting for about 2 years now, and have made quite a few items for my collection.</p>
    <p>Some of those items include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Scarves</li>
        <li>Hats</li>
        <li>Hand warmers</li>
        <li>A sweater</li>
        <li>Future project: blanket</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>Below are some pictures of some of my creations and what yarn I like to use for knitting!</p>

    <h2>An Excerpt from Evelina</h2>

    <div>

        <p>This was, indeed, a grateful proposal to me, and I listened to it with undisguised pleasure. And, in short, I was obliged to consent to a compromise in merely deferring the day till Thursday! He readily undertook to engage my father's concurrence in this little delay; and I besought him, at the same time, to make use of his influence to obtain me a second interview, and to represent the deep concern I felt in being thus banished his sight.</p>

        <p>He would then have spoken of settlements; but I assured him I was almost ignorant of the word.</p>
        
        <p>And now, my dearest Sir, what is your opinion of these hasty proceedings? Believe me, I half regret the simple facility with which I have suffered myself to be hurried into compliance; and, should you start but the smallest objection, I will yet insist upon being allowed more time.</p>
        
        <p>I must now write a concise account of the state of my affairs to Howard Grove, and to Madame Duval.</p>
        
        <p>Adieu, dearest and most honoured Sir! everything at present depends upon your single decision; to which, though I yield in trembling, I yield implicitly.</p>
        
        <p>.</p>
        
        <p>EVELINA IN CONTINUATION. Oct. 11th.</p>
        
        <p>YESTERDAY morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Lord Orville went to the Hot Wells, to wait upon my father with my double petition.</p>
        
        <p>Mrs. Beaumont then, in general terms, proposed a walk in the garden. Mrs. Selwyn said she had letters to write; but Lady Louisa rose to accompany Mrs. Beaumont.</p>
        
        <p>I had had some reason to imagine, from the notice with which her Ladyship had honoured me during breakfast, that her brother had acquainted her with my present situation: and her behaviour now confirmed my conjectures: for, when I would have gone up stairs, instead of suffering me, as usual, to pass disregarded, she called after me with an affected surprise, "Miss Anville, don't you walk with us?"</p>
